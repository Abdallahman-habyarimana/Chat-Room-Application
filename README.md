There is a couple of package you need to install while this application failed to run 
 
To run the client side :

$ npm run open

To run the server side: 

$ npm run server

or

$ npm start

or

$ heroku local web

NB: You might get the error like 

Error: Cannot find module 'express', the solution is to

$ npm i --save-dev express
$ npm i -s--dev opener concurrently
